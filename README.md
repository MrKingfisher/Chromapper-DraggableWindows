# Chromapper-DraggableWindows
This plugin allows you to drag around different windows in ChroMapper that may get in the way, including:
- Chroma Colour Wheel

- Strobe Generator

You can also now switch between using Shift and Click to drag or just click to drag!

# Known Issues
- Strobe Generator Window only remembers horizontal position when you close the window and reopen it.
- Color Selection Window doesn't fully hide itself and is a bit slow to disappear.
- Bpm Tapper 'opens/closes with right shift key' does not fully hide window when closed after benig dragged vertically up.
- Note editor 'N key' is slow to fully apear once toggled on and will temporarily immobilize the option to move it for aprox 2 seconds (vertically).
- Note editor also vertically resets its position after being closed.

# Todo - maybe?
